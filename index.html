					<p>Bonjour!  My name is Kyle and I am an experienced chef originally from Minnesota. With over 15 combined years in the food service industry, I have spent over half my life working with the things I love most, food and people.  I have worked almost every conceivable job in this business, from drive-thru attendant, to dishwasher, from line cook to the executive chef of multiple high-profile restaurants in a major North American city. I’ve seen and done it all.</p>
					
					<p>My most recent venture has been to move with my girlfriend of 5 years (soon to be fiancé, I just ordered the ring! Shhh it’s a secret!....) to Austin, Texas.  I moved to Austin to perfect my already strong skill in American pit BBQ.  I started learning this craft 7 years ago in Minneapolis running my own catering events.  Eventually I was so in love with BBQ I had to move the mecca of it all, central Texas.  It is here that I have perfected my craft and truly learn what Texas BBQ is all about.  Now that you posted that advertisement, I am sure you are going to hear from many imposters.  These imposters won’t tell you the importance of the local wood harvested in central Texas that contributes to the flavor. They likely won’t tell that Texas BBQ is centered around salt and ground pepper ONLY rubbed meat to create an intense bark.  The meats that are the hallmark of the Texas lineup are brisket, sausage (made from brisket trim), pork ribs, and turkey.  The rest is just fluff.  Being that I am a culinary professional that has been the executive chef of multiple fine dining establishments, (before the age of 28) there is a lot I can do with that ‘fluff’ to make you menu even more progressive, but our focus MUST be on Texas traditionalism. If you want to make a killer Texas BBQ restaurant in Paris, traditionalism and authenticity are the key.  These combined with a little showmanship, and we would have a winner on our hands.   I think this is something we would be able to spread like wildfire over Europe.  I am so excited!</p>	
					
					<p>If you want to walk this road with me, you are not just getting a professional bbq pitmaster and executive chef, but a world class showman, a top-level marketer, and a leader who can help launch your start up to high success.</p>

					<p>I am you man that you want to do this with, so let’s jump on a skype or zoom call and I can tell you even more as to why!  I am excited to working together, and I promise you, you won’t regret it.</p>
					
					<p>Always onward and upward, </p>
					
					<p>Chef Kyle Dahl </p>
